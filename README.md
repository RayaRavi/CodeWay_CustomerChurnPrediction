# Customer Churn Prediction Details :
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project repository! 
This project aims to develop a robust model for predicting customer churn within a subscription-based service or business. 
Leveraging the "Bank Customer Churn Prediction" dataset, which includes historical customer data encompassing usage behavior and demographic features, we endeavor to create a predictive model that can effectively identify customers at risk of churning.

# Key Features:
Utilizes the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset for model training and evaluation.
Incorporates various features including usage behavior and customer demographics to capture diverse aspects of customer behavior.
Explores machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict customer churn.
Implements feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance and interpretability.
Includes thorough model evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of churn prediction.
Provides clear documentation and code comments for ease of understanding and replication.
